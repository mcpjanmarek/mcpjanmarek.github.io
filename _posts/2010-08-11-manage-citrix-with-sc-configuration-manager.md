<div>
  <em>The System Center team is working in partnership with Citrix to integrate the management of XenApp with Configuration Manager. We’ve put together a </em><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/9/5/4/954F7927-1FE7-470E-BA9B-A1AFEE142849/Citrix Connector for System Center Configuration Manager.pdf"><em>white paper</em></a><em> that outlines how the new capabilities can be used to improve enterprise application management. The Citrix Connector for Configuration Manager will enable unified management of applications across the desktop and XenApp Server farm environment. The connector enhances Configuration Manager, enabling administrators to orchestrate the tasks required to deliver applications to XenApp Servers and publish XenApp hosted applications seamlessly and with minimal impact to the user. </em>
</div>

_The Citrix Connector for Configuration Manager infrastructure will enable application deployment to target devices (non-managed, non-Windows, smartphone, and thin client) that couldn’t be managed before with Configuration Manager alone. Typical Configuration Manager packages and programs are reused and delivered to XenApp servers. The Citrix Connector for Configuration Manager populates collections with XenApp Farms, Folders and Worker Groups for targeting application deployment. In the end, application deployment is accomplished by a coordination of Configuration Manager task sequence advertisements and Citrix Power and Capacity Management, created with the familiar Configuration Manager console that orchestrates the application installation on XenApp servers._
